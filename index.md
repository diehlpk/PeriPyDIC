### About

The code is written for the following usage:
* State-based Peridynamic simulation in 1D for elastic and viscelatic materials
* State-based Peridynamic forces and energy computations out of real displacements obtained from Digital Image Correlation data from a beam or fiber, for the case of an elastic or viscoelastic material
* _(being developed)_ State-based Peridynamic simulations in 2D for elastic and viscoelastic materials
* _(being developed)_ State-based Peridynamic forces and energy computations out of real displacements obtained from Digital Image Correlation, for the case of an elastic or viscoelastic material

### Authors 
The code is developed by Ilyass Tabiai (@ilyasst), Rolland Delorme (@rollanddelorme) and Patrick Diehl (@diehlpk). The code for the package is developed at the _Laboratory of Multiscale Mechanics_, _École Polytechnique Montréal_, Montréal, QC, Canada.
